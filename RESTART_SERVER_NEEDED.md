# ⚠️ RESTART YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER

## The Issue
Your browser is still seeing the old cached version of the controller.

## Solution: Restart the Server

### If you're using `php artisan serve`:

1. **Stop the server:**
   - Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running

2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

### If you're using Laravel Valet or Homestead:

```bash
# Restart PHP-FPM
sudo service php8.2-fpm restart
# or
sudo service php8.1-fpm restart
```

### If you're using XAMPP/WAMP:

1. Stop Apache
2. Start Apache again

## After Restarting

1. **Clear your browser cache** (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
2. Or open in **Incognito/Private window**
3. Go to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/assessments/17/questions`

## Should Work Now! ✅

The variable `$allQuestions` is properly defined in the controller.
