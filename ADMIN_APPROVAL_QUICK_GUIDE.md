## 💡 Best Practices

### When Approving:
- ✅ Verify email is verified (green checkmark)
- ✅ Review registration date
- ✅ Check student name and email are valid

### When Rejecting:
- ✅ **Always provide a rejection reason** - it helps students improve
- ✅ Be clear and constructive in feedback
- ✅ Mention what they can do to reapply successfully

### Good Rejection Reason Examples:
```
✅ "Email domain is not from an educational institution. Please register with your college email."

✅ "Profile information incomplete. Please provide valid student ID and enrollment details."

✅ "Registration from unauthorized location. Please contact admissions office for verification."

❌ "No" (Too vague)
❌ "Invalid" (Not helpful)
❌ "" (Empty - student won't know why)
```
