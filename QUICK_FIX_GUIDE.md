# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix Guide - Chatbot Showing Wrong Assessments

## Problem
Chatbot shows 5 assessments instead of 2

## Solution (2 Steps)

### âœ… Step 1: Database Fixed (DONE)
Removed 3 duplicate "Test Assessment" entries. Only 2 assessments are now active:
1. Aptitude Assessment - Logical Reasoning
2. Technical Assessment - Programming Fundamentals

### ðŸ”„ Step 2: Restart RAG Service (DO THIS NOW)

**Find the terminal where your RAG service is running:**

1. Look for a terminal/command prompt window showing:
   ```
   "Starting Enhanced RAG Service..."
   or
   "Starting Production RAG Service..."
   ```

2. In that window:
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the service
   - Wait for it to stop completely

3. Restart the service:
   ```bash
   cd python-rag
   
   # If you were using:
   python simple_rag_service.py
   # OR
   start_production_rag.bat
   ```

4. Wait for message: "Service running on http://localhost:8001"

### âœ… Step 3: Test

1. Go to your student panel: http://localhost:8000
2. Login as student
3. Click chat bubble
4. Ask: **"What assessments are available?"**

**Expected:** Should now show only 2 assessments!

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Can't find RAG service terminal?**  
A: Start a new one:
```bash
cd python-rag
start_production_rag.bat
```

**Q: Still shows 5 assessments?**  
A: Verify database was fixed:
```bash
php check-available-assessments.php
```
Should show exactly 2 active assessments.

**Q: RAG service won't start?**  
A: Check if it's already running:
- Visit: http://localhost:8001
- If you see service info â†’ it's running!

## What Was Wrong?

Your **database had 5 active assessments** (including 3 duplicates named "Test Assessment").

Your **RAG chatbot was working correctly** - it accurately showed what was in the database!

We fixed the **database** (removed duplicates), now just need to **restart RAG** so it reloads the updated data.

- [ ] Chatbot shows 2 assessments (not 5)
- [ ] Assessment names are correct:
