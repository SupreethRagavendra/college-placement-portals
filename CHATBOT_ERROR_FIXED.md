# âœ… Chatbot Error FIXED

## Problem
When asking "Show available assessments", the chatbot was showing:
```
ðŸ”´ Error: I'm experiencing technical difficulties right now. 
Please try again in a moment or contact support if the issue persists.
```

---

## Root Cause
**Bug in RAG Service** (`python-rag/context_handler.py` line 419):

```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
actual_assessment_names = [a.get('title', '').lower() for a in available_assessments]
```

**Error:** `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'`

The issue: Even though `.get('title', '')` was supposed to return empty string as default, some assessments had `None` as the title value, and calling `.lower()` on `None` caused the crash.

---

## Solution Applied

```python
# AFTER (FIXED):
actual_assessment_names = [(a.get('title') or a.get('name') or '').lower() for a in available_assessments if a.get('title') or a.get('name')]
```

**What this does:**
1. Tries to get `title` first
2. If `title` is None, tries `name`
3. If both are None, uses empty string ``
4. Only processes assessments that have at least one name field
5. Then safely calls `.lower()` on the result

---

## Steps Taken

1. âœ… **Identified Error** - Found `NoneType.lower()` error in RAG logs
2. âœ… **Fixed Bug** - Updated `context_handler.py` with safe None handling
3. âœ… **Restarted Service** - Stopped old RAG service and started new one
4. âœ… **Verified Health** - Confirmed RAG service is running and healthy

## Test It Now

1. **Open chatbot** in your browser
2. **Refresh page** (Ctrl + F5)
3. **Ask:** "Show available assessments"
4. **Expected Result:** Should now show list of assessments without error

## Error Log (Before Fix)

```
2025-10-16 21:04:35 - context_handler - ERROR - Error processing query: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'

## How to Test

### Test Query 1: Show Assessments
**Input:** "Show available assessments"
**Expected:** List of 2 assessments with details

### Test Query 2: General Question
**Input:** "What assessments can I take?"
**Expected:** Same assessments list

### Test Query 3: Assessment Details
**Input:** "Tell me about Python Basics assessment"
**Expected:** Details about specific assessment

---

## Prevention

Added robust None handling:
- Uses `or` operator to chain fallbacks
- Filters out assessments without names
- Safe string conversion before `.lower()`
- Handles both `title` and `name` fields
