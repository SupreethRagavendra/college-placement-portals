# Cipher Error Fix

## Issue
```
Unsupported cipher or incorrect key length. Supported ciphers are: aes-128-cbc, aes-256-cbc, aes-128-gcm, aes-256-gcm.
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because the Laravel application key in the `.env` file had an invalid format or length. Laravel requires a properly formatted 32-character base64 encoded key for encryption operations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Generated New Application Key
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

This command:
- Generated a new valid 32-character base64 encoded key
- Automatically updated the APP_KEY in the `.env` file
- Ensured compatibility with supported ciphers (aes-128-cbc, aes-256-cbc, aes-128-gcm, aes-256-gcm)

### 2. Cleared All Caches
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

### 3. Rebuilt All Caches
```bash
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

## Verification
After implementing these changes, the cipher error should be resolved and the application should function normally.

## New APP_KEY Format
The new APP_KEY follows the correct format:
```
APP_KEY=base64:{32-character base64 encoded string}
```

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always use `php artisan key:generate` to create application keys
2. Never manually edit the APP_KEY value
3. Ensure the .env file is properly configured when deploying to new environments
