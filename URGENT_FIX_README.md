# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Your RAG Service is Not Running!

## The Problem

Your chatbot is giving **fallback responses** because the RAG service isn't running.

## The Fix (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Command Prompt
Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter

### Step 2: Run These Commands
```bash
cd d:\project-mini\college-placement-portal
START_RAG_NOW.bat
```

### Step 3: Keep Window Open
**Do NOT close the terminal!** RAG service needs to keep running.

### Step 4: Test
Go to chatbot and ask: **"What's the passing score?"**

**Should say:** "60%" (not show assessment list!)
