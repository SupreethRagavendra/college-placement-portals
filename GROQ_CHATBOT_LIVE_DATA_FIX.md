# Groq Chatbot - Live Assessment Data Fix

## Issue Fixed
**Problem:** Chatbot was giving generic responses like "log in to view assessments" instead of showing actual assessment names like "test3567".

**Root Cause:** The Python RAG service wasn't receiving student context from Laravel, and the prompt wasn't explicitly instructing the AI to use actual assessment names.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Laravel Controller - Added Context Gathering

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Student/GroqChatbotController.php`

**Added Method:** `gatherStudentContext()`
- Fetches available assessments from database
- Gets student's completed assessments with scores
- Retrieves in-progress assessments
- Calculates performance summary

**What it sends to RAG service:**
```php
[
    'available_assessments' => [
        [
            'id' => 1,
            'name' => 'test3567',  // Actual assessment name
            'description' => '...',
            'category' => 'Technical',
            'duration' => '30 minutes',
            'total_marks' => 100,
            'pass_percentage' => '60%',
            'difficulty' => 'Medium'
        ],
        // ... more assessments
    ],
    'completed_assessments' => [...],
    'in_progress_assessments' => [...],
    'performance_summary' => [...]
]
```

### 2. Python RAG Service - Enhanced Context Building

**File:** `python-rag-groq/context_handler_groq.py`

**Changes:**

#### A. Fixed Context Formatting
- Now extracts assessment `name` field correctly (was looking for `title`)
- Formats assessment data with all details (name, category, duration, difficulty)
- Shows exact assessment names in context sent to Groq AI

#### B. Updated System Prompt
**Critical new instructions:**
```
1. ALWAYS use the EXACT assessment names from context
2. When student asks "what assessments available", list ACTUAL names
3. DO NOT give generic responses - student IS logged in
4. Use specific details (name, category, duration)
5. Be direct and list by actual names (e.g., "test3567")
6. Never say "I don't have access" - you DO have the data
```

#### C. Enhanced Fallback Responses
- Fallback now also uses actual assessment names
- Lists real assessments even if Groq API fails
- Shows assessment details (category, duration)

## How It Works Now

### Query Flow:
```
1. Student asks: "Show available assessments"
   ↓
2. Laravel GroqChatbotController:
   - Calls gatherStudentContext()
   - Fetches: test3567, Python Basics, SQL Quiz, etc.
   - Sends to Python RAG service
   ↓
3. Python RAG Service:
   - Receives student context with ACTUAL assessment names
   - Builds detailed context string
   - Sends to Groq AI with explicit instructions
   ↓
4. Groq AI Response:
   "Here are your available assessments:
    • test3567 (Technical) - 30 minutes
    • Python Basics (Programming) - 45 minutes
    • SQL Quiz (Database) - 25 minutes"
   ↓
5. Student sees REAL assessment names!
```

## Testing

### Test Queries:

**1. Available Assessments:**
```
"What assessments are available?"
"Show available tests"
"Which tests can I take?"
```

**Expected Response:**
```
Here are your available assessments:

• test3567 (Technical) - 30 minutes
• Python Programming (Coding) - 45 minutes
• SQL Basics (Database) - 25 minutes

You can click on any assessment to view details and start the test.
```

**2. Completed Assessments:**
```
"Show my results"
"What tests have I completed?"
"My assessment history"
```

**Expected Response:**
```
Your recent results:

• test3567: 75% - PASSED on 2025-01-06
• Python Quiz: 82% - PASSED on 2025-01-05
• SQL Test: 55% - FAILED on 2025-01-04
```

**3. Performance Summary:**
```
"How am I performing?"
"Show my overall performance"
```

**Expected Response:**
```
Performance Summary:

Total Completed: 5 assessments
Passed: 4
Failed: 1
Average Score: 72.5%
Pass Rate: 80%

Keep up the good work! Focus on SQL topics to improve further.
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check RAG Service is Running
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "groq_model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

### 2. Test Context Gathering (Laravel)
```bash
# In Laravel tinker
php artisan tinker

$controller = new \App\Http\Controllers\Student\GroqChatbotController();
$reflection = new \ReflectionMethod($controller, 'gatherStudentContext');
$reflection->setAccessible(true);
$context = $reflection->invoke($controller, 1); // Student ID 1
print_r($context);
```

**Expected:** Array with available_assessments showing actual assessment names

### 3. Test Full Flow
1. Login as student
2. Open chatbot (bottom-right icon)
3. Type: "What assessments are available?"
4. Should see actual assessment names like "test3567"

## Files Modified

### Laravel (PHP)
- ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/Student/GroqChatbotController.php`
  - Added `gatherStudentContext()` method
  - Modified `chat()` to send context to RAG service

### Python RAG Service
- ✅ `python-rag-groq/context_handler_groq.py`
  - Fixed `_build_context()` to use correct field names
  - Enhanced `_build_groq_prompt()` with explicit instructions
  - Improved `_generate_fallback()` to use actual data

---

## Before vs After

### Before ❌
**Student:** "Show available assessments"

**Chatbot:** "To view available assessments, please follow these steps: 1. Log in to your student account 2. Navigate to the assessments page from your dashboard..."

### After ✅
**Student:** "Show available assessments"

**Chatbot:** "Here are your available assessments:

• test3567 (Technical) - 30 minutes - Medium difficulty
• Python Programming (Coding) - 45 minutes - Easy difficulty
• Database Fundamentals (SQL) - 25 minutes - Hard difficulty

You can click 'View All Assessments' to see more details and start any test."

## Key Improvements

1. **Real Data**: Shows actual assessment names from database
2. **Personalized**: Each student sees only their available assessments
3. **Detailed**: Includes category, duration, difficulty, description
4. **Accurate**: No generic "log in" messages - student IS logged in
5. **Helpful**: Provides actionable information with exact assessment names
6. **Performance**: Includes scores, pass/fail status, attempt history
7. **Fallback**: Even if Groq fails, fallback uses real data

---

## Troubleshooting

### Chatbot still shows generic responses

**Check 1: RAG Service Running?**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

**Check 2: Database Connection?**
```bash
# In Laravel
php artisan tinker
\App\Models\Assessment::where('is_active', true)->count()
```

**Check 3: Student Context Being Sent?**
- Check Laravel logs: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Look for: "Groq Chatbot query" with context data

**Check 4: Python RAG Receiving Context?**
- Check Python logs: `tail -f python-rag-groq/rag_service.log`
- Look for: "Student context received" messages

### Assessments not showing

**Possible causes:**
1. No assessments marked as `is_active = true`
2. Assessment dates outside current date range
3. Assessment status is not 'active'

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check assessments
SELECT id, name, is_active, status, start_date, end_date 
FROM assessments 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Activate assessment
UPDATE assessments 
SET is_active = true, status = 'active'
WHERE id = 1;
```

---

## System Requirements

- ✅ Python RAG service running on port 8001
- ✅ Laravel server running
- ✅ Active assessments in database
- ✅ Student logged in
- ✅ Groq API key configured

---

## Performance Notes

- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds with Groq LPU™
- **Cache**: Generic queries cached for 5 minutes
- **Context Size**: Limited to 5 assessments in detailed view
- **Database**: Indexed queries for fast retrieval

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add Question Preview**: Show sample questions from assessments
2. **Study Recommendations**: Based on weak areas
3. **Time Management**: Suggest optimal times to take tests
4. **Peer Comparison**: Anonymous comparison with other students
5. **Progress Tracking**: Visual charts of improvement over time

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**

**Last Updated:** January 7, 2025  
**Version:** 2.1.0  
**Tested:** ✅ Working with live assessment data
