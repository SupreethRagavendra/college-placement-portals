# ✅ Chatbot Fixed and Ready!

## 🎉 Problem Solved!

Your chatbot was showing **Mode 2 (Yellow)** header but giving **Mode 3 (Offline)** responses. This has been fixed!

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **RAG Service Started**
- The Python RAG service wasn't running
- Started with: `python main.py` in the `python-rag` directory
- Service is now running on `http://localhost:8001`
- Health check confirmed: ✅ Connected to database

### 2. **Route Names Corrected**
- Fixed action button URLs in fallback responses
- Changed `route('student.assessments')` → `route('student.assessments.index')`
- Changed `route('student.results')` → `route('student.assessment.history')`
- Action buttons will now work correctly

### 3. **Created Easy Start Script**
- Created `START_RAG_SERVICE.bat` for easy one-click start
- No need to remember commands anymore

---

## 🚀 How to Start Everything

### Method 1: Using Batch Files (Easiest)

**Terminal 1 - Laravel:**
```bash
php artisan serve
```

**Terminal 2 - RAG Service:**
```bash
# Just double-click this file:
START_RAG_SERVICE.bat

# OR run in terminal:
cd python-rag
python main.py
```

### Method 2: Manual Commands

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
php artisan serve
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
cd python-rag
python main.py
```
