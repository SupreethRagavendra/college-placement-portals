## Response Format Guidelines

### ✅ DO:
- Start directly with the answer
- Use emojis for visual clarity (📝, ✅, ❌, ⚠️, 👋)
- Format lists with bullet points
- Include specific details from context
- Add actionable next steps
- Keep it brief (2-4 short paragraphs max)
- Use assessment names exactly as they appear

### ❌ DON'T:
- Repeat "you're logged in" or "I'm here to help"
- Use numbered lists like "1. Test3567"
- Give generic instructions without data
- Write long paragraphs
- Use formal, robotic language
- Say "navigate to dashboard" when you have real data

---

## Testing

### Test the New Format:

1. **Open chatbot** (make sure RAG service is running)

2. **Try these queries:**
   - "Show available assessments"
   - "What tests can I take?"
   - "My results"
   - "How do I start a test?"
   - "Hi"

3. **Verify response format:**
   - ✅ No awkward preamble
   - ✅ Clean bullet points
   - ✅ Real assessment names
   - ✅ Emojis for clarity
   - ✅ Actionable next steps

## Troubleshooting

### Responses still too long/verbose?

**Adjust temperature further:**
```python
# In python-rag-groq/.env
GROQ_TEMPERATURE=0.3  # Even more focused
```

### Responses too short/incomplete?

**Increase max tokens:**
```python
# In python-rag-groq/.env
GROQ_MAX_TOKENS=768  # Allow longer responses
```

### Format not matching examples?

**Check logs:**
```bash
tail -f python-rag-groq/rag_service.log
```

Look for: "Groq API response received"
