# ⚠️ YOU MUST RESTART YOUR COMPUTER ⚠️

## The Core Issue

Your system has a **fundamental DNS resolution problem**:

- ✅ Command-line tools (`nslookup`, `ping`) CAN resolve: `db.wkqbukidxmzbgwauncrl.supabase.co`
- ❌ Applications (PHP, .NET) CANNOT resolve the same hostname
- This is because they use different DNS resolution mechanisms

## What We've Done

1. ✅ Removed IP mappings from hosts file
2. ✅ Set Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) on all network adapters
3. ✅ Flushed DNS cache multiple times
4. ✅ Configured cache and sessions to use files instead of database
5. ✅ Cleared all Laravel caches

## Why It's Still Not Working

**Network/DNS changes in Windows require a FULL SYSTEM RESTART to take effect properly.**

The Windows DNS resolver cache and network stack need to be completely reinitialized, which only happens during a restart.

## What Happens If You Don't Restart

You'll keep getting one of these errors:
- `could not translate host name to address: Unknown host` ❌
- `Tenant or user not found` ❌  
- Application won't connect to database ❌

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Save All Your Work
Close all applications and save everything.

### Step 2: Restart Your Computer
**Start → Power → Restart**

### Step 3: After Restart
Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:

```bash
cd D:\project-mini\college-placement-portal

# Test DNS resolution from PHP
php -r "echo 'PHP resolves to: ' . gethostbyname('db.wkqbukidxmzbgwauncrl.supabase.co') . PHP_EOL;"

# If it shows an IP address (not the hostname), continue:

# Start your server
php artisan serve

# Open browser and go to:
# http://localhost:8000/login
```

## Expected Result After Restart

### Before Restart:
```
PHP resolves to: db.wkqbukidxmzbgwauncrl.supabase.co  ❌ (failed)
```

### After Restart:
```
PHP resolves to: 2406:da18:243:740a:6d30:33f9:31ae:d2fa  ✅ (success!)
```

## If It Still Doesn't Work After Restart

Then we have deeper issues and will need to try:

### Option A: Check Network Settings Manually
1. Open Control Panel → Network and Sharing Center
2. Click your network connection
3. Click Properties
4. Select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)"
5. Click Properties
6. Select "Use the following DNS server addresses:"
7. Preferred DNS: `8.8.8.8`
8. Alternate DNS: `8.8.4.4`
9. Click OK and restart again

### Option B: Enable IPv6
1. In the same Network Properties window
2. Make sure "Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)" is CHECKED ✅
3. Click OK and restart

### Option C: Check if VPN/Antivirus is Blocking
- Temporarily disable VPN if you're using one
- Temporarily disable antivirus/firewall
- Try on a different network (mobile hotspot)

### Option D: Contact Your Network Administrator
If you're on a corporate/university network:
- They might be blocking Supabase
- They might have custom DNS settings
- Ask them to whitelist `*.supabase.co`

## Why This Specific Issue is Difficult

Supabase hosts your database at:
- Hostname: `db.wkqbukidxmzbgwauncrl.supabase.co`
- This uses a **load balancer** that routes to your specific project
- The load balancer **requires proper hostname resolution** (not IP addresses)
- When you connect via IP, the load balancer doesn't know which tenant you are
- Result: "Tenant or user not found" error

## Files We Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.env` | Set CACHE_STORE=file, SESSION_DRIVER=file |
| `hosts` | Removed IP mappings (if any) |
| Network DNS | Set to Google DNS 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 |

## Backup Files Created

- `.env.backup_before_cache_fix`
- `.env.backup_before_pooler_fix`
- `.env.backup_switch_to_sqlite`
- `.env.backup_before_sqlite`
- `.env.backup_final_fix`
- `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.backup_*`

## Summary

**🔄 RESTART YOUR COMPUTER NOW! 🔄**

This is not optional. All the DNS/network configuration changes we made REQUIRE a full system restart to take effect.

After restart, your application should work perfectly!

## Quick Command Reference (After Restart)

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd D:\project-mini\college-placement-portal

# Test DNS (should show an IP, not the hostname)
php -r "echo gethostbyname('db.wkqbukidxmzbgwauncrl.supabase.co') . PHP_EOL;"

# Test database connection
php artisan tinker --execute="DB::connection()->getPdo(); echo 'Connected!';"

# Start server
php artisan serve

# Open browser to:
# http://localhost:8000/login
```
