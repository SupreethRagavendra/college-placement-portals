# Chatbot Response Formatting - FIXED ✅

## Issue
Chatbot responses were showing as one long run-on sentence with no line breaks or proper formatting:

```
Hi there! 👋 i'm your placement assistant. I can help you with: • viewing available assessments • checking your results • taking tests • portal navigation you have 1 assessment ready to take...
```

## Root Cause
**Groq AI was not adding line breaks** in its responses, returning everything as a single line of text, which made the formatMarkdown function unable to properly structure the content.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt (Python)
Added explicit formatting instructions to the Groq AI system prompt:

```python
FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
- Put blank line (\n\n) after greeting
- Put blank line before and after lists
- Each bullet point on new line with • prefix
- Assessment details: one detail per line with dash prefix
- Always add line breaks for better readability
```

### 2. Updated Format Rules
Changed from:
```
4. **Format Well**: Use bullet points, numbers, bold for emphasis
```

To:
```
4. **Format Well**: ALWAYS use proper line breaks (\n) between paragraphs and sections
5. **Structure**: Use bullet points (•), blank lines, and bold (**text**) for readability
```

### 3. Added User Message Reminder
```python
user_message = f"{query}\n\n(Please format your response with proper line breaks and bullet points as shown in examples)"
```

### 4. Improved formatMarkdown Function (JavaScript)
Enhanced to handle multiple formatting scenarios:
- Wraps regular lines in `<p>` tags with proper margin
- Better bullet point detection (• and - prefix)
- Excludes assessment detail lines (- category:, - duration:) from becoming list items
- Proper list closing and spacing

```javascript
// Regular line gets wrapped in paragraph
if (trimmed.length > 0) {
    formatted.push(`<p style="margin: 6px 0;">${line}</p>`);
}
```

## Technical Details

### How It Works Now:

**Step 1: Groq AI Generation**
```
Groq receives system prompt with formatting rules
→ Generates response with \n line breaks
→ Uses bullet points (•) and proper structure
→ Returns formatted text string
```

**Step 2: JavaScript Processing**
```
Response received from API
→ formatMarkdown() processes text
→ Converts \n to <br>
→ Detects bullet points and creates <ul>
→ Wraps paragraphs in <p> tags
→ Returns formatted HTML
```

**Step 3: Typing Animation**
```
Extracts plain text for typing
→ Types character by character
→ Shows formatted HTML when complete
→ Preserves all formatting
```
