### 2.2.2 Workflow in Existing Systems

**Administrator Workflow:**
1. Manually create assessment questions in documents
2. Schedule assessments through announcements
3. Monitor attendance physically or through spreadsheets
4. Collect submitted answer sheets or responses
5. Evaluate answers manually or review automated results
6. Enter scores in records
7. Generate reports manually or using basic tools
8. Provide feedback through email or in person

**Student Workflow:**
1. Check notice boards or emails for schedules
2. Attend physical or online assessments
3. Submit answers through paper or LMS
4. Wait for manual evaluation (often takes days/weeks)
5. Check results on notice boards or websites
6. Request clarifications through email or in person
7. Receive generic study materials without personalization

## 2.8 Summary

This chapter presented a comprehensive analysis of the College Placement Training Portal with AI-Powered Chatbot system. The key findings are:

1. **Existing System Analysis**: Current approaches to placement training management suffer from manual processes, limited automation, poor accessibility, and lack of personalized guidance.

2. **Problem Identification**: Major problems include time-consuming manual evaluation, lack of real-time feedback, limited scalability, poor data management, and absence of intelligent assistance for students.

3. **Proposed System**: A modern web-based solution with comprehensive features including automated assessment management, real-time evaluation, AI-powered chatbot, detailed analytics, and role-based access control.

4. **Feasibility Analysis**: The project is highly feasible from all perspectives:
   - **Technical**: All required technologies are mature, well-documented, and freely available
   - **Economic**: Development costs are minimal (â‚¹2,000-4,000), with annual savings of â‚¹1,80,000-2,80,000 and ROI of 233%
   - **Operational**: High user acceptance expected, minimal training required, and low maintenance overhead
   - **Schedule**: Completable within 4.5 months, well within academic semester timeline

5. **Requirements Specification**: Detailed functional requirements cover all modules (authentication, admin, student, chatbot) and non-functional requirements ensure quality attributes (performance, security, usability, reliability).

6. **System Requirements**: Standard hardware and freely available software meet all development and deployment needs, with no proprietary or expensive tools required.

The analysis confirms that the proposed system effectively addresses all identified problems in existing systems, is technically and economically viable, and provides significant value to both educational institutions and students. The next chapter will present the literature review of technologies and existing systems in detail.
