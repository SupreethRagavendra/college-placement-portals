## Tips for Academic Submission

1. **Review and Customize**: Go through the entire document and customize sections specific to your implementation
2. **Add Screenshots**: Take actual screenshots of your running application and add them to Chapter 6
3. **Update Statistics**: If your implementation differs, update numbers (e.g., number of tables, test cases)
4. **Verify Code**: Ensure code snippets match your actual implementation
5. **Check References**: Add any additional references you used during development
6. **Proofread**: Review for any placeholder text that needs replacement
7. **Format Consistency**: Ensure formatting is consistent throughout when converting
8. **Add Diagrams**: Consider creating actual UML diagrams from the ASCII art provided
9. **Include Evidence**: Add commit history, test logs, or deployment screenshots as evidence
10. **Get Feedback**: Have your guide review the draft before final submission
