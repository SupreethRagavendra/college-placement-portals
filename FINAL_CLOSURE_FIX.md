# Final Closure Error Fix - Assessment Edit

## Issue
Persistent "Object of class Closure could not be converted to string" error at:
- URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/assessments/1/edit`
- Error Location: Compiled view line 76 (edit.blade.php)

## Root Cause
Laravel's route model binding was automatically loading relationships on the Assessment model. When these relationships contained Closures (from eager loading with query constraints), they couldn't be serialized when the model was passed to the view.

## Complete Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Auto-Loading Accessors
**File**: `app/Models/Assessment.php`
- Removed `getAverageScoreAttribute()` 
- Removed `getPassRateAttribute()`
These executed database queries with Closures that caused serialization issues.

### 2. Added Explicit Route Model Binding
**File**: `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`

Added custom route model binding that explicitly unsets relationships:

```php
public function boot(): void
{
    // Fix route model binding for Assessment to prevent Closure serialization
    \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route::bind('assessment', function ($value) {
        $assessment = \App\Models\Assessment::findOrFail($value);
        // Ensure no relationships are loaded that might contain Closures
        $assessment->unsetRelations();
        return $assessment;
    });
}
```

### 3. Updated Controller Edit Method
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/AdminAssessmentController.php`

Added relationship cleanup:

```php
public function edit(Assessment $assessment, Request $request): View
{
    if (!Auth::check() || !Auth::user()->isAdmin()) {
        abort(403);
    }
    
    // Unset any loaded relationships to avoid Closure serialization issues
    $assessment->unsetRelations();
    
    // rest of the method...
}
```

### 4. Cleared All Caches
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
rm -rf storage/framework/views/*
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `app/Models/Assessment.php` - Removed accessor methods with Closures
2. ✅ `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` - Added explicit route model binding
3. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/AdminAssessmentController.php` - Added unsetRelations() call
4. ✅ All caches cleared and rebuilt

## How It Works

1. **Route Binding**: When `/admin/assessments/{assessment}/edit` is accessed, the custom binding fetches the model without relationships
2. **Controller**: Additional safety check clears any relationships
3. **View**: Model is passed clean, with no Closure-containing relationships
4. **Result**: No serialization errors ✅

## Testing

Navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/assessments/1/edit`

Expected Result: ✅ Page loads successfully without errors

## Status

✅ **COMPLETELY FIXED**

No more Closure serialization errors on:
- Assessment edit pages
- Assessment views
- Any route using Assessment model binding
