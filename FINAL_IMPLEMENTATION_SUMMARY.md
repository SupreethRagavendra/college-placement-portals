## 🎯 Three-Tier Detection System

### **Tier 1: Unclear Query Clarification** (NEW!)
**Trigger**: Relevance 30-45% OR vague phrases OR very short  
**Action**: Acknowledge query, explain purpose, redirect to studies  
**Example**: "tell me something" → Clarification message

### **Tier 2: Off-Topic Detection**
**Trigger**: Relevance < 30% OR clear off-topic keywords  
**Action**: Personalized redirect based on performance  
**Example**: "What's the best game?" → Performance-based redirect

### **Tier 3: Normal Processing**
**Trigger**: Relevance ≥ 30% AND clear intent  
**Action**: Process with RAG system  
**Example**: "Show me assessments" → Normal RAG response

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Adjust Cutoff Threshold
```python
# In intelligent_cutoff.py
def is_off_topic(self, query: str, relevance_threshold: int = 30):
    # 40 = Stricter
    # 30 = Balanced (default)
    # 20 = Lenient
```

### Adjust Unclear Range
```python
# In intelligent_cutoff.py
def is_unclear_query(self, query: str, relevance_score: int) -> bool:
    if 30 <= relevance_score <= 45:  # Adjust range here
        return True
```

### Add Custom Keywords
```python
# High relevance (placement-related)
self.high_relevance = [
    'assessment', 'test', 'placement',
    'your_keyword_here'
]

# Low relevance (distractions)
self.low_relevance = [
    'game', 'movie', 'party',
    'your_distraction_here'
]

# Unclear phrases
unclear_phrases = [
    'what about', 'tell me',
    'your_vague_phrase_here'
]
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Log Messages to Watch
```
[INFO] Query relevance score: 35% (H:0, M:1, L:0)
[INFO] Unclear query detected: relevance=35% - Using AI clarification
[WARNING] LOW RELEVANCE (15%) - Triggering intelligent cutoff
[INFO] Off-topic detected: entertainment
```

### Metrics to Track
1. **Average Relevance Score** per student
2. **Unclear Query Frequency** (daily/weekly)
3. **Off-Topic Query Frequency** (daily/weekly)
4. **Most Common Categories** (entertainment, personal, etc.)
5. **Clarification Effectiveness** (do students refocus?)
6. **API Call Reduction** (cost savings)

### SQL Queries for Analytics
```sql
-- Track unclear queries
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as unclear_count
FROM chatbot_messages
WHERE model_used = 'intelligent_cutoff_clarification'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);

-- Track off-topic queries
SELECT 
    JSON_EXTRACT(metadata, '$.category') as category,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM chatbot_messages
WHERE model_used = 'intelligent_cutoff'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Average relevance score
SELECT 
    student_id,
    AVG(JSON_EXTRACT(metadata, '$.relevance_score')) as avg_relevance
FROM chatbot_messages
WHERE created_at > '2025-10-09'
GROUP BY student_id;
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Monitor Regularly
- Check logs daily for patterns
- Track relevance score distribution
- Identify common unclear queries
- Adjust thresholds based on data

### 2. Gather Feedback
- Ask students about redirect messages
- Monitor engagement after redirects
- Track if students take suggested actions
- Iterate based on real-world usage

### 3. Balance Strictness
- Don't be too restrictive (frustrates users)
- Don't be too lenient (defeats purpose)
- Find the sweet spot for your audience
- Adjust seasonally (exam vs. normal periods)

### 4. Customize Messages
- Tailor to your institution's culture
- Use appropriate language and tone
- Add relevant emojis and formatting
- Keep messages encouraging, not preachy

### 5. Iterate and Improve
- Add new keywords as patterns emerge
- Refine unclear phrase detection
- Update redirect messages based on effectiveness
- Expand categories as needed
