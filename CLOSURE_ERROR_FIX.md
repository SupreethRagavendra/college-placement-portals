# Closure Error on Assessment Edit - FIXED

## Issue
Error: "Object of class Closure could not be converted to string"  
Location: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/assessments/1/edit`

## Root Cause
The Assessment model had attribute accessors (`getAverageScoreAttribute` and `getPassRateAttribute`) that executed database queries with Closures. When the model was passed to the view via `compact('assessment')`, Laravel tried to serialize these accessors, causing the Closure error.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Problematic Accessors
**File**: `app/Models/Assessment.php`

**Removed:**
```php
public function getAverageScoreAttribute()
{
    return $this->studentAssessments()->avg('obtained_marks') ?? 0;
}

public function getPassRateAttribute()
{
    $totalAttempts = $this->studentAssessments()->count();
    // ... more code with Closures
}
```

These auto-loading accessors caused serialization issues when models were passed to views.

### 2. Cleared All Caches
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:cache
rm -rf storage/framework/cache/data/*
```

## Solution
Instead of using auto-loading attribute accessors (which can cause Closure serialization issues), use explicit method calls in views:

```php
// In views, use:
$assessment->studentAssessments()->avg('obtained_marks')
// or create explicit non-accessor methods if needed
```

## Files Modified
- ✅ `app/Models/Assessment.php` - Removed problematic accessors

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Assessment edit page now works without Closure errors

## Testing
1. Navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/assessments`
2. Click "Edit" on any assessment
3. Page loads successfully without errors ✅
