# Student Approval System - Complete Documentation

## Overview

The College Placement Portal implements a comprehensive student approval/rejection system where administrators can review new student registrations and either approve or reject them. Students receive automated email notifications about their application status.

## üéØ Features

### ‚úÖ Core Functionality
- **Admin Approval Workflow**: Admins can review pending student registrations
- **Email Notifications**: Automated emails sent to students upon approval/rejection
- **Rejection Reasons**: Admins can provide optional feedback when rejecting applications
- **Bulk Operations**: Approve or reject multiple students at once
- **Status Tracking**: Track student status (pending, approved, rejected)
- **Beautiful Email Templates**: Professional HTML email templates with branding

## üîÑ Workflow

### 1. Student Registration
1. Student registers on the platform via `/register`
2. Account is created with `is_approved = false` and `status = 'pending'`
3. Student is redirected to login with a message about pending approval

### 2. Admin Review
1. Admin logs in and navigates to **Admin Dashboard**
2. Clicks on **Pending Students** to see all students awaiting approval
3. Reviews student information:
   - Name
   - Email
   - Registration date
   - Email verification status

### 3. Approval Process
**Option A: Individual Approval**
1. Admin clicks **Approve** button next to student name
2. Confirms the approval action
3. System updates:
   - Sets `is_approved = true`
   - Sets `admin_approved_at = current timestamp`
   - Sets `status = 'approved'`
4. Student receives approval email automatically

**Option B: Bulk Approval**
1. Admin selects multiple students using checkboxes
2. Clicks **Approve Selected** button
3. Confirms bulk approval
4. All selected students are approved
5. Each student receives individual approval email

### 4. Rejection Process
**Option A: Individual Rejection**
1. Admin clicks **Reject** button next to student name
2. Rejection modal opens with:
   - Student details (name, email)
   - Optional rejection reason textarea
   - Confirmation checkbox
3. Admin optionally provides rejection reason
4. Confirms rejection
5. System updates:
   - Sets `admin_rejected_at = current timestamp`
   - Sets `status = 'rejected'`
   - Stores `rejection_reason` if provided
6. Student receives rejection email with reason (if provided)

**Option B: Bulk Rejection**
1. Admin selects multiple students using checkboxes
2. Clicks **Reject Selected** button
3. Confirms bulk rejection
4. All selected students are rejected
5. Each student receives individual rejection email

### 5. Student Email Notification
Students receive one of two email types:

#### Approval Email
- **Subject**: "üéâ Account Approved - Welcome to [College Name]!"
- **Content**:
  - Congratulatory message
  - Status badge showing "Approved"
  - Next steps (login, complete profile, browse opportunities, take assessments)
  - Call-to-action button to access portal
  - Contact information for support

#### Rejection Email
