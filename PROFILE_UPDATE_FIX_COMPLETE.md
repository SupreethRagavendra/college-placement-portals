# Profile Update Fix - Complete Solution

## Issue
The profile name update was failing with HTTP 500 error due to session configuration issues.

## Root Causes
1. Session driver was set to 'database' but sessions table had issues
2. ProfileUpdateRequest was not handling disabled email field properly
3. Missing error handling in ProfileController

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ProfileController.php
- Added try-catch error handling
- Added logging for debugging
- Better error messages to user

### 2. ProfileUpdateRequest.php  
- Added `prepareForValidation()` method to remove disabled email field
- Added null checks in logging
- Ensures only 'name' field is validated

### 3. Session Configuration
- Changed default SESSION_DRIVER from 'database' to 'file' in .env.example
- This avoids database session issues

## How to Apply Fix

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
1. Open your `.env` file
2. Change:
   ```
   SESSION_DRIVER=database
   ```
   To:
   ```
   SESSION_DRIVER=file
   ```
3. Clear caches:
   ```bash
   php artisan optimize:clear
   ```

### Option 2: Fix Database Sessions
If you want to keep using database sessions:
```bash
# Mark migration as run
php artisan migrate:refresh --path=database/migrations/2025_10_08_182800_create_sessions_table.php

# Clear sessions
php artisan tinker --execute="DB::table('sessions')->truncate()"

# Clear all caches
php artisan optimize:clear
```

## Verification
1. Go to `/profile` page
2. Change your name
3. Click "Save Changes"
4. Should see "Saved successfully!" message

## Files Modified
- `app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php` - Added error handling
- `app/Http/Requests/ProfileUpdateRequest.php` - Fixed validation
- `.env.example` - Changed default session driver

## Prevention
- Always ensure session driver matches your setup
- Use 'file' driver for development, 'database' for production
- Add proper error handling to all form submissions
