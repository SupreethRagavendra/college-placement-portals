# Slow Internet Connection Fix - Complete

## Problem Solved
Fixed `SQLSTATE[08006] [7] timeout expired` errors that occurred when running the application on slow internet connections (like in the faculty room).

## Changes Made

### 1. Cache Configuration (`config/cache.php`)
**Changed:** Default cache driver to use local file storage instead of remote database

**Why:** 
- Cache queries were timing out on slow internet connections
- File cache stores data locally in `storage/framework/cache/data`
- No internet connection required for cache operations
- Much faster response times

**Impact:** Application will now cache data locally, eliminating cache-related timeout errors completely.

---

### 2. Database Configuration (`config/database.php`)
**Changed:** Increased PostgreSQL connection and query timeouts

**Updates Made:**
- Added `connect_timeout` setting: 60 seconds (configurable via `DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`)
- Increased `PDO::ATTR_TIMEOUT` from 30 to 90 seconds (configurable via `DB_TIMEOUT`)
- Applied to both `pgsql` and `pgsql_cache` connections

**Why:**
- Slow internet needs more time to establish connections
- Prevents premature timeout errors on complex queries
- Gives adequate time for database operations even on poor connections

### 3. Cache Cleared
Cleared both application and configuration caches to ensure new settings take effect immediately.

## Environment Variables (Optional)

You can customize these timeouts in your `.env` file if needed:

```env
# Cache Configuration
CACHE_STORE=file                # Use file cache (default, recommended for local dev)

# Database Timeout Settings (optional - defaults are now better)
DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=60           # Connection timeout in seconds (default: 60)
DB_TIMEOUT=90                   # Query timeout in seconds (default: 90)
```

---

## Benefits

✅ **Works on Slow Internet:** Application remains functional even with poor connectivity  
✅ **Fast Local Caching:** No internet required for cache operations  
✅ **Resilient Database Queries:** Longer timeouts prevent premature failures  
✅ **Production-Ready:** File cache works both locally and on production servers  
✅ **Zero Configuration:** Works out of the box with sensible defaults

## Testing

The application should now work smoothly even on slow internet connections. Try:

1. Running the application in the faculty room (or other slow internet locations)
2. Cache operations will be instant (no network needed)
3. Database queries will have more time to complete (90 seconds instead of 30)

---

## What This Means

- **Before:** Cache queries hit remote database → timeout on slow internet → error
- **After:** Cache queries use local files → instant → no errors

- **Before:** Database connection timeout after 30 seconds → error
- **After:** Database connection timeout after 90 seconds → enough time for slow connections
