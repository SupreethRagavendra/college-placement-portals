# 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Add Question Not Working
**Error:** `SQLSTATE[23502]: Not null violation: 7 ERROR: null value in column "category_id"`

**Root Cause:** 
- Missing `question_type` field when creating question
- Missing `category` field (enum type)

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `AdminAssessmentController@storeQuestion` to include:
```php
'question_type' => 'mcq',  // Added
'category' => $assessment->category,  // Added
'created_by' => Auth::id() ?? 1,  // Added fallback
```

**File Modified:** `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AssessmentController.php` (Line 285-301)

### 2. ❌ Questions Page Error
**Error:** `Method Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection::total does not exist`

**Root Cause:** 
- View was calling `$questions->total()` on paginated results
- Statistics were trying to use paginated collection methods

**Fix Applied:**
1. Modified controller to pass separate variables:
   - `$questions` - Paginated for display
   - `$allQuestions` - All questions for statistics

2. Updated view to use `$allQuestions->count()` instead of `$questions->total()`

**Files Modified:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AssessmentController.php` (Line 223-240)
- `resources/views/admin/assessments/questions.blade.php` (Line 36-69)

---

### 3. ❌ Duplicate Assessment Not Working
**Error:** Various issues with duplication

**Root Cause:** 
- Handling of `title` vs `name` attributes
- Missing timestamp updates
- Order not preserved for questions
- Status not properly set

**Fix Applied:**
Enhanced `duplicate()` method with:
```php
// Handle both title and name
$newAssessment->title = ($assessment->title ?? $assessment->name) . ' (Copy)';
$newAssessment->name = ($assessment->name ?? $assessment->title) . ' (Copy)';

// Set safe defaults
$newAssessment->status = 'draft';
$newAssessment->is_active = false;

// Preserve question order
$questions = $assessment->questions()->withPivot('order')->get();
$syncData = [];
foreach ($questions as $question) {
    $syncData[$question->id] = ['order' => $question->pivot->order ?? 0];
}
$newAssessment->questions()->sync($syncData);
```

**File Modified:** `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AssessmentController.php` (Line 193-225)

### 4. ✅ Bonus Fix: Update Question
**Issue:** Update question method was not properly updating all fields

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `updateQuestion()` method to properly update:
- Question text
- All options (A, B, C, D)
- Correct option index
- Options array
- Marks
- Difficulty level

**File Modified:** `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AssessmentController.php` (Line 356-383)
