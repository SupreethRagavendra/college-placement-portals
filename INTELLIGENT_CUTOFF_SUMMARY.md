## 📁 Files Created

### 1. **intelligent_cutoff.py** (Core System)
**Location**: `python-rag/intelligent_cutoff.py`

**Key Components**:
- `IntelligentCutoff` class with comprehensive detection logic
- `calculate_relevance_score()` - Scores queries 0-100% based on keywords
- `is_off_topic()` - Detects irrelevant queries with 30% threshold
- `generate_redirect_message()` - Creates personalized motivational redirects
- `get_study_suggestions()` - Provides context-aware study recommendations

**Features**:
- ✅ 25+ high-relevance keywords (assessment, placement, coding, etc.)
- ✅ 15+ medium-relevance keywords (help, guide, question, etc.)
- ✅ 35+ low-relevance keywords (game, movie, party, etc.)
- ✅ 5 off-topic categories (entertainment, personal, sports, random, casual)
- ✅ Smart scoring algorithm with multiple factors
- ✅ False-positive prevention (checks for career terms)

**Flow**:
```
Query → Relevance Check → Off-topic? 
                            ↓ Yes: Redirect message
                            ↓ No: Normal RAG processing

## 🧠 How It Works

### Relevance Scoring Algorithm

```python
Score = 50 (baseline)
  + (High relevance keywords × 30)    # assessment, test, placement
  + (Medium relevance keywords × 15)  # help, guide, question
  - (Low relevance keywords × 20)     # game, movie, party
  + (Has question mark × 5)           # Indicates inquiry
  - (Short query, no keywords × 10)   # Likely casual chat
  - (Long query, no keywords × 15)    # Likely off-topic rambling

Final Score = Capped between 0-100%
```

### Cutoff Threshold: **30%**

**Why 30%?**
- Balanced approach (not too strict, not too lenient)
- Blocks obvious distractions (games, movies, dating)
- Allows legitimate questions (even if poorly worded)
- Tested with 20+ query samples

## 🎭 Personalized Redirects

### Based on Student Performance Level

#### **Beginner** (0 assessments completed)
```
"Hey John! I know you're curious about other things, but let's focus on 
getting started with your placement prep! 🚀 You have 3 assessments waiting 
for you. Let's tackle your first one together!"
```

#### **Needs Improvement** (<60% average)
```
"Hi Sarah, I understand you have other interests, but your placement prep 
needs attention right now! 📚 Your current average is 45% - let's work on 
improving that together! You have 1 more assessment to practice."
```

#### **Good Performer** (60-80% average)
```
"Hey Mike! You're doing well at 72%, but let's keep that momentum going! 💪 
Taking a mental break is fine, but remember - consistency is what gets you 
to excellence! Ready to tackle the next challenge?"
```

#### **Excellent Performer** (>80% average)
```
"Impressive work, Emma! You're at 88% - that's fantastic! 🌟 But champions 
stay focused. Let's maintain that excellence! Challenge yourself with the 
remaining 1 assessment. Keep pushing! 💪"
```

      "📝 Take an available assessment",
      "🚀 Start your first assessment",
      "📚 Check study materials",
      "🎯 Set learning goals"
    ]
  },
  "query_type": "off_topic",
  "model_used": "intelligent_cutoff"
}
```

### Relevant Query

## 🚀 Implementation

### Quick Start (Automated)
```bash
cd python-rag
implement_cutoff.bat
```

### Manual Integration
1. Ensure `intelligent_cutoff.py` exists in `python-rag/`
2. Backup original: `copy context_handler.py context_handler_backup.py`
3. Replace: `copy context_handler_enhanced.py context_handler.py`
4. Restart RAG service: `python main.py`

### Verification

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Adjust Cutoff Threshold
Edit `intelligent_cutoff.py`, line ~145:
```python
def is_off_topic(self, query: str, relevance_threshold: int = 30):
    # Change threshold here:
    # 40 = Stricter (blocks more)
    # 30 = Balanced (default)
    # 20 = Lenient (blocks less)
```

### Add Custom Keywords
Edit `intelligent_cutoff.py`, lines 15-50:
```python
self.high_relevance = [
    'assessment', 'test', 'exam',
    # Add your keywords here
]

self.low_relevance = [
    'game', 'movie', 'music',
    # Add distraction keywords here
]
