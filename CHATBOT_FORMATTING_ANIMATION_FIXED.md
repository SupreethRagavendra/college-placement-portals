## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Markdown Formatting Function ✅

**Added `formatMarkdown()` function:**
```javascript
function formatMarkdown(text) {
    // Convert **bold** to <strong>
    text = text.replace(/\*\*([^*]+)\*\*/g, '<strong>$1</strong>');
    
    // Convert line breaks
    text = text.replace(/\n/g, '<br>');
    
    // Convert bullet points • to actual list items
    // Auto-detect and create <ul> lists
    
    // Convert numbered lists
    // Auto-detect and create <ol> lists
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Converts `**bold**` to **bold**
- ✅ Converts `\n` to line breaks
- ✅ Converts `• item` to proper bullet lists
- ✅ Converts `1. item` to numbered lists
- ✅ Proper HTML structure

### 2. Typing Animation Function ✅

**Added `addMessageWithTyping()` function:**
```javascript
function addMessageWithTyping(text, debugInfo = '', sender) {
    // Create message bubble
    // Extract plain text from formatted HTML
    // Type character by character (15ms per char)
    // Show formatted HTML when complete
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Character-by-character typing effect
- ✅ 15ms per character (natural speed)
- ✅ Auto-scrolls as typing
- ✅ Shows formatted HTML after typing completes
- ✅ Maintains proper formatting

### 3. Enhanced Response Handler ✅

**Updated response handling:**
```javascript
// Get response text
let responseText = data.message || data.response;

// Format and type with animation
addMessageWithTyping(responseText, debugInfo, 'bot');

// Show action buttons after typing completes
setTimeout(() => addActionButtons(data.actions), responseText.length * 10);
```
