# âœ… Render Docker Deployment Checklist

Complete checklist for deploying College Placement Portal + RAG Service to Render using Docker.

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Repository Preparation
- [ ] All code is committed to GitHub repository
- [ ] `.env` file is not committed (check .gitignore)
- [ ] `render.yaml` file is created and committed
- [ ] `Dockerfile` is created for Laravel
- [ ] `python-rag/Dockerfile` is created for RAG service
- [ ] `.dockerignore` file is created
- [ ] All Docker config files in `docker/` directory
- [ ] `.env.example` file exists with all required variables

### Environment Variables Preparation
- [ ] Gmail app password generated (or SendGrid API key ready)
- [ ] Supabase database credentials available
- [ ] Application key ready to generate
- [ ] All required environment variables documented

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Render Account
- [ ] Sign up at [render.com](https://render.com)
- [ ] Verify email address
- [ ] Connect GitHub account

### Step 2: Create Web Service
- [ ] Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Select repository: `college-placement-portal`
- [ ] Choose branch: `main` (or your default branch)

### Step 3: Configure Laravel Service Settings
- [ ] **Name**: `college-placement-portal`
- [ ] **Runtime**: `Docker`
- [ ] **Region**: `Oregon (US West)`
- [ ] **Plan**: `Free`
- [ ] **Health Check Path**: `/healthz`
- [ ] **Auto-Deploy**: `Yes` (main branch)
- [ ] Dockerfile will handle build automatically

### Step 4: Set Laravel Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
**Only these need to be set manually in Render:**
- [ ] `APP_KEY` = `base64:Tru9xzXURTw16wL/3WUX/Ok5WYYcuDCvPxgdXWq+g/4=`
- [ ] `DB_PASSWORD` = `Supreeeth24#`
- [ ] `GROQ_API_KEY` = `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`

**Note**: All other variables are configured in `render.yaml`

### Step 5: Create RAG Service
- [ ] Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
- [ ] Connect same GitHub repository
- [ ] **Name**: `rag-service`
- [ ] **Runtime**: `Docker`
- [ ] **Dockerfile Path**: `./python-rag/Dockerfile`
- [ ] **Docker Context**: `./python-rag`
- [ ] **Region**: `Oregon (US West)`
- [ ] **Plan**: `Free`
- [ ] **Health Check Path**: `/health`
- [ ] **Auto-Deploy**: `Yes` (main branch)

### Step 6: Set RAG Service Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
**Only these need to be set manually:**
- [ ] `DB_PASSWORD` = `Supreeeth24#`
- [ ] `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` = `your_openrouter_api_key_here`

**Note**: All other variables are configured in `render.yaml`

### Step 7: Deploy Both Services
- [ ] Push code to GitHub: `git push origin main`
- [ ] Both services will auto-deploy
- [ ] Wait for builds to complete (10-15 minutes total)
- [ ] Check build logs for any errors
- [ ] Note both deployment URLs

### Step 8: Verify Deployment
**Test Laravel Service:**
- [ ] Health check: `https://college-placement-portals.onrender.com/healthz`
- [ ] Database test: `https://college-placement-portals.onrender.com/test-db`
- [ ] Main site: `https://college-placement-portals.onrender.com/`

**Test RAG Service:**
- [ ] Health check: `https://rag-service.onrender.com/health`

### Step 9: Database Migrations (Auto-runs in start.sh)
**Migrations run automatically on startup, but verify:**
- [ ] Check logs for "Running database migrations"
- [ ] Check logs for "âœ… Laravel application ready!"
- [ ] If needed, run manually in Shell: `php artisan migrate --force`

### Step 10: Test Full Application
- [ ] Landing page loads with styling
- [ ] Registration form works
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Admin dashboard accessible
- [ ] Student dashboard accessible
- [ ] RAG chatbot responds (if configured)
