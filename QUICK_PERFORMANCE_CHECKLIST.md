## üîß Manual Steps Required

### 1. Environment Configuration (.env file)
**Priority: HIGH**

Check and update your `.env` file:

```bash
# For PRODUCTION - ensure these are set:
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false

# For DEVELOPMENT - keep as:
APP_ENV=local
APP_DEBUG=true
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never set `APP_DEBUG=true` in production!**

### 2. Test Website Performance
**Priority: HIGH**

1. **Open the website** and test all pages:
   - Landing page: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   - Student dashboard
   - Admin dashboard
   - Assessment pages
   - Profile pages

2. **Verify functionality**:
   - [ ] All images load properly
   - [ ] Icons display correctly (Font Awesome)
   - [ ] Forms work properly
   - [ ] Chatbot works
   - [ ] No JavaScript errors in console

3. **Test on slow connection**:
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Select "Slow 3G" from the throttling dropdown
   - Reload page and verify:
     - [ ] Images lazy load properly
     - [ ] No layout shifts occur
     - [ ] Page remains functional

### 3. Run Performance Test
**Priority: MEDIUM**

Use one of these tools to measure performance:

**Option A: Google Lighthouse (Built into Chrome)**
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Lighthouse" tab
3. Select "Performance" category
4. Click "Analyze page load"
5. **Target Scores**:
   - Performance: 80-100 (Green)
   - Accessibility: 90-100
   - Best Practices: 90-100
   - SEO: 90-100

**Option B: PageSpeed Insights**
- Visit: https://pagespeed.web.dev/
- Enter your URL
- Check both Mobile and Desktop scores

### 4. Optional: Image Compression
**Priority: LOW (But good for future)**

If you want even better performance:

1. **Compress logo image**:
   - Current: `public/css/logo1-removebg-preview.png`
   - Use: https://tinypng.com/ or https://squoosh.app/
   - Save 30-50% file size

2. **Convert to WebP** (for modern browsers):
   - Online tool: https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-webp
   - Save 25-35% additional file size

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If images don't load:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check browser console for errors

### If icons don't show:
- Font Awesome is now deferred, so icons may load slightly after the page
- This is normal and improves performance
- Icons should appear within 100-200ms

### If you need to clear Laravel caches:
```bash
cd D:\project-mini\college-placement-portal
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
php artisan view:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan config:cache
```

### If RAG service is slow:
The Python RAG service is separate and not affected by these optimizations.
To optimize the RAG service, that would require separate changes.
