# ✅ KIT Design Successfully Applied to Entire Site!

## 🎉 What Was Fixed

The issue was that you had **multiple layout files** with different designs:

### ❌ Before (What was wrong):
1. **Welcome Page** - Was using `landing.blade.php` with OLD purple/blue design
2. **Student Dashboard** - Was using `layouts.student` with OLD purple (#667eea) 
3. **Admin Panel** - Was using `layouts.admin` with OLD purple (#6a6ef0)
4. **Different colors** everywhere - No consistency

### ✅ After (What's fixed):
1. **Welcome Page** - Now uses `welcome.blade.php` with **KIT Design**
2. **Student Dashboard** - Updated to **KIT Purple** (#7e22ce) & **Orange** (#f97316)
3. **Admin Panel** - Updated to **KIT Purple** & **Orange**
4. **Consistent KIT branding** across entire site!
