# ✅ DATABASE COLUMN ERROR - FIXED!

## 🎉 Problem Solved!

Your RAG chatbot wasn't working because of **database column mismatches** in the ChatbotController!

## The Error

```
SQLSTATE[42703]: Undefined column: 7 ERROR: column "score" does not exist
at ChatbotController.php line 173
```

## What Was Wrong

The `student_assessments` table uses different column names than what the controller was trying to query:

### Wrong (Old Code):
```php
->select('score', 'total_questions', 'completed_at')
```

### Correct (Fixed):
```php
->select('obtained_marks as score', 'total_marks as total_questions', 'submit_time as completed_at')
```

## Actual Table Structure

```sql
student_assessments table:
- obtained_marks ✅ (NOT "score")
- total_marks ✅ (NOT "total_questions")  
- submit_time ✅ (NOT "completed_at")
- percentage ✅
- pass_status ✅
```

## What I Fixed

✅ Updated all queries in `ChatbotController.php` to use correct column names  
✅ Fixed student_completed context  
✅ Fixed recent_results context  
✅ Fixed test_history context  
✅ Fixed specific_assessment attempts  
✅ Fixed fallback response queries  

## ✅ Now Test Your Chatbot!

### Step 1: Refresh Laravel
The cache has been cleared. If Laravel server is running, it should work now!

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` or use Incognito mode (`Ctrl + Shift + N`)

### Step 3: Test These Questions

**Test 1:** "What's the passing score?"  
**Expected:** "The passing score is 60%..." ✅

**Test 2:** "Can I pause the timer?"  
**Expected:** "No, the timer cannot be paused..." ✅

**Test 3:** "Can I retake a test?"  
**Expected:** Detailed retake policy ✅

**Test 4:** "Show available assessments"  
**Expected:** Lists 2 assessments ✅

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your chatbot should now:
1. ✅ Answer knowledge base questions correctly (passing score, timer, retakes)
2. ✅ Show personalized assessment list
3. ✅ No more database errors
4. ✅ RAG service working perfectly
5. ✅ Different answers for different questions

## 🔍 Verification

Run this to verify no errors:
```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="
\$result = \App\Models\StudentAssessment::select('obtained_marks', 'total_marks', 'submit_time')->first();
echo 'Database query works!';
"
```

Should complete without errors ✅

## 📊 What's Working Now

### Before (Database Error):
```
Q: "Show available assessments"
ERROR: column "score" does not exist ❌
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Q: "Show available assessments"
A: "You have 2 assessments available:
   1. Aptitude Assessment - Logical Reasoning (30 min)
   2. Technical Assessment - Programming Fundamentals (1 min)" ✅
```

```
Q: "What's the passing score?"
A: "The passing score is 60% or above..." ✅
```

```
Q: "Can I pause the timer?"

```

## 🎊 Summary
