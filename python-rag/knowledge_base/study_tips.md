# Study Tips for Better Scores

## Aptitude Improvement
- Practice mental math daily to improve calculation speed
- Solve puzzles and logical problems from various sources
- Time yourself on practice questions to build speed
- Learn shortcuts and tricks for quick calculations
- Use online platforms like IndiaBix, GeeksforGeeks for practice
- Focus on pattern recognition in logical reasoning
- Practice data interpretation with real-world datasets
- Work on percentage, ratio, and proportion problems daily

## Technical Improvement
- Code daily on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeChef
- Understand concepts deeply, don't just memorize solutions
- Review data structures fundamentals regularly
- Practice with time constraints to simulate test conditions
- Implement each data structure from scratch at least once
- Solve problems in multiple programming languages
- Read and understand others' code for different approaches
- Keep a notebook of important algorithms and their complexity

## Time Management Strategies
- Divide total time by number of questions to set per-question time limit
- Spend first 2-3 minutes skimming through all questions
- Mark questions as easy, medium, hard and tackle accordingly
- Don't get stuck on one question - move on and come back later
- Reserve last 5 minutes for review and checking answers
- Use elimination technique for multiple choice questions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't rush through questions without reading carefully
- Avoid second-guessing correct answers unnecessarily
- Don't leave questions unanswered - make educated guesses
- Don't ignore negative marking if applicable
- Avoid spending too much time on difficult questions
- Don't start an assessment when tired or distracted

## Subject-Specific Tips

### For Programming Questions
- Read problem statement twice to understand requirements
- Think about edge cases and boundary conditions
- Write pseudocode before actual code if time permits
- Test your solution with sample inputs mentally
- Consider time and space complexity
- Use meaningful variable names for clarity

### For Aptitude Questions
- Eliminate obviously wrong options first
- Look for patterns in sequence questions
- Draw diagrams for geometry problems
- Use approximation for quick calculations
- Practice Vedic math techniques
- Memorize common squares, cubes, and tables

### For Verbal Questions
- Read passage completely before answering
- Look for context clues in vocabulary questions
- Apply grammar rules you've learned
- Trust your first instinct on language questions
- Practice reading newspapers and articles daily
