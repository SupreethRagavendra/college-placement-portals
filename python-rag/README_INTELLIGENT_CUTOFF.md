# 🎯 Intelligent Cutoff System - Complete Implementation Guide

## 📌 Overview

The **Intelligent Cutoff System** is an advanced feature for the RAG chatbot that intelligently detects irrelevant queries and redirects students to focus on placement preparation. It uses a sophisticated relevance scoring algorithm and provides personalized, motivational responses based on student performance.

```bash
cd python-rag
implement_cutoff.bat
```

### Step 2: Restart RAG Service
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Test the System

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Relevance Scoring Algorithm

Every query is scored from **0-100%** based on:

```python
Base Score: 50

+ High Relevance Keywords × 30    # assessment, test, placement, coding
+ Medium Relevance Keywords × 15  # help, guide, question, explain
- Low Relevance Keywords × 20     # game, movie, party, dating
+ Has Question Mark × 5           # Indicates inquiry
- Short Query (< 3 words) × 10    # Likely casual chat
- Long Query, No Keywords × 15    # Likely off-topic

Final Score: Capped between 0-100
```

### 2. Cutoff Threshold

**Default: 30%**

- Queries **below 30%** → Blocked and redirected
- Queries **30% or above** → Processed normally

### 3. Off-Topic Categories

The system detects 5 categories:

1. **Entertainment** (games, movies, music, social media)
2. **Personal** (relationships, dating, romance)
3. **Sports** (cricket, football, tournaments)
4. **Random** (weather, food, travel, shopping)
5. **Casual Chat** (bored, fun, jokes)

### 4. Personalized Redirects

Based on student performance:

| Performance Level | Avg Score | Message Tone |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Beginner** | 0% (no assessments) | Encouraging, welcoming |
| **Needs Improvement** | < 60% | Motivating, supportive |
| **Good** | 60-80% | Positive, momentum-focused |
| **Excellent** | > 80% | Congratulatory, challenging |

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Adjust Cutoff Threshold

Edit `intelligent_cutoff.py` (line ~145):

```python
def is_off_topic(self, query: str, relevance_threshold: int = 30):
    # Adjust threshold here:
    # 40 = Stricter (blocks more queries)
    # 30 = Balanced (default, recommended)
    # 20 = Lenient (blocks fewer queries)
```

**Recommendations:**
- **Strict Mode (40%)**: For exam periods or focused study sessions
- **Balanced Mode (30%)**: Default, works for most scenarios
- **Lenient Mode (20%)**: For casual learning environments

---

### Add Custom Keywords

Edit `intelligent_cutoff.py` (lines 15-50):

```python
# Add placement-related keywords
self.high_relevance = [
    'assessment', 'test', 'exam', 'quiz',
    'your_custom_keyword',  # Add here
]

# Add distraction keywords
self.low_relevance = [
    'game', 'movie', 'music',
    'your_distraction_keyword',  # Add here
]
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Too Many False Positives

**Symptom**: Relevant queries being blocked

**Solution**:
1. Lower threshold to 20%
2. Add career terms to whitelist
3. Review keyword lists

### Issue: Not Blocking Enough

**Symptom**: Off-topic queries getting through

**Solution**:
1. Raise threshold to 40%
2. Add more low-relevance keywords
3. Expand off-topic categories

### Issue: Redirect Messages Too Harsh

**Symptom**: Students feel restricted

**Solution**:
1. Edit `generate_redirect_message()` in `intelligent_cutoff.py`
2. Soften language, add more emojis
3. Focus on encouragement over restriction

### Issue: System Not Working

**Symptom**: No relevance scores in logs

**Solution**:
1. Check if `intelligent_cutoff.py` exists
2. Verify `context_handler.py` is replaced
3. Restart RAG service
4. Check for import errors in logs

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Monitor Regularly
- Check logs daily for relevance patterns
- Adjust threshold based on student feedback
- Track off-topic categories

### 2. Customize Messages
- Tailor redirects to your institution's culture
- Use appropriate language and tone
- Add relevant emojis and formatting

### 3. Balance Strictness
- Don't be too restrictive (students will disengage)
- Don't be too lenient (defeats the purpose)
- Find the sweet spot for your audience

### 4. Gather Feedback
- Ask students about redirect messages
- Monitor engagement metrics
- Adjust based on real-world usage

### 5. Iterate and Improve
- Add new keywords as patterns emerge
- Refine messages based on effectiveness
- Update thresholds seasonally (exam vs. normal periods)
