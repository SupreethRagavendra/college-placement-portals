# RESTART RAG Service After Updates

## Changes Made:
1. ‚úÖ Fixed query to show ONLY assessments student hasn't taken
2. ‚úÖ Removed fake signature/name from AI responses
3. ‚úÖ Made responses more concise and natural
4. ‚úÖ Added strict instructions to not hallucinate assessment names

## How to Restart:

### Step 1: Stop Current RAG Service
In the terminal running `python main.py`, press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### Step 2: Start RAG Service Again
```powershell
cd D:\project-mini\college-placement-portal\python-rag
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Test
Ask in chatbot: **"What assessments are available?"**

**Expected Result:**
- Shows ONLY "Quantitative Aptitude" (the one not taken)
- NO fake assessments
- NO signature like "Best regards, [Your Name]"
- Concise, helpful response

## What Was Fixed:

### Before (WRONG):
```
Available assessments:
- Quantitative Aptitude ‚úÖ (Real)
- Logical Reasoning ‚ùå (Fake - AI made it up)
- Programming Fundamentals ‚ùå (Fake - AI made it up)

Best regards,
[Your Name]
College Placement Training Portal Support
```

### After (CORRECT):
```
You have 1 assessment available:

üìù Quantitative Aptitude
   ‚Ä¢ Category: Aptitude
   ‚Ä¢ Duration: 10 minutes
   
Ready to start? Click 'View Assessments' below!
```

---

## Database Query Now Filters Properly:

```sql
-- OLD (showed all active assessments)
SELECT * FROM assessments WHERE is_active = true

-- NEW (shows only what student hasn't taken)
SELECT a.* FROM assessments a
WHERE a.is_active = true
AND a.id NOT IN (
    SELECT assessment_id 
    FROM student_assessments 
    WHERE student_id = 52  -- your student ID
)
```

This ensures RAG only shows assessments from the student's dashboard!
